# Donate n Find | Voyage-9:  
https://chingu-voyages.github.io/v9-toucans-team-12/ 

## Project Overview 
Our project is the Front-end for Donate n Find, our own new invented online non-profit organization providing a new platform for people donating and/or seeking items available for donation. Offering a possession no longer needed/or used to gratify someone else's need is a GREAT feeling. Sports equipment or clothing your children outgrew, kitchen appliances you donâ€™t use anymore or collectables you want to pass along. If you think about it, there are likely many things in your possession no use to you, but that would totally make someone else's day. We created Donate n Find to pay forward the spirit of giving and receiving and to also provide a no-hassle process for donating and finding items, to make the process uncomplicated for the community. <br />

## What We Learnt !

- We learnt more about Git/GitHub & how to integrate ZenHub in our GitHub to be able to stay organised & work more proficiently as a team to meet our project requirements  
- We learnt how to resolve communication issues & conflicts successfully & we thank Chingu facilitators who have always been here to provide us with the best assistance & advice when needed 
- We learnt how to help each other & teach each other more about the technologies we picked for our project - jQuery, Bootstrap & Sass - so we can all better meet the needs of our project within the best of our ability  
- We learnt how to use a responsive, mobile-first approach for the development of our project by making use of web development inspection tools, CSS media queries & Bootstrap's grid system & classes to ensure the compability of our project on modern tablet & mobile devices
- We built new experience in the development of a new project from scratch & we also learnt the do's & dont's involved in taking up such a challenge 
- We learnt how to set up & follow a development workflow which always gave everyone on our team a chance to share their ideas & voice their opinions & in times of conflicts we learnt how to speak up & still be respectful to one another 
- We built new hands-on experience making pull requests using GitHub to effectively contribute to our project & also built new hands-on experience in resolving merge conflicts locally within our chosen development enviroment before merging our changes to our development branch in our remote repository
- We learnt how to work & communicate more effectively within a team & with the valuable information provided to us in Chingu's handbook, we learnt how to develop our project using the Scrum/Agile methodology by succesfuly completing our sprint tasks each weekly sprint over a 6 weeks period of time
